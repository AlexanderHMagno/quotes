# Quotes On DEV 
ITs a project created by ALEXANDER HORTUA, following the rules provided by RED ACADEMY, In this project you can find the following techonology:

* PHP
* JavaScript/JQuery/AJAX (REST API)
* Wordpress (CMS)
* CSS / SASS
* HTML 
* GULP-GIT

# Basic IDEA

Create a Data base with different Quotes, on the main screen every time that the user load the page, a different quote will appear. This was created using the 
Wordpress loop and PHP language. Additional, every time a user push the button on the main Screen, it will create a get process using the AJAX
technology which means that the page is not going to refresh, in fact it will bring the quote inmediately, asinchoronomous. 

# Mqueries  

This project was specially created for 3 differents screens mobil (under 620px), tablet (under 1080px) and screens (over 1080px), I used the 
mquerie for this, combining the SASS (mixin). 

# AJAX

Ajax was used for getting and posting information directly to the data base. Any user (with proper permisions) could post any new quote,
which will be posted on hold until one of the adminster will post it in our webpage. 

# Javascript / JQuery

I used the jquery wrapper, if you notice on my code I use the Tag Jquery every time i need to call it, and I didnt use the short code $. This 
had to be  because wordpress has preinstaled jquery, and I didnt want to unistall it to install it again.
