# Quotes On DEV 
ITs a project created by ALEXANDER HORTUA, following the rules provided by RED ACADEMY, In this project, you can find the following technology:

* PHP
* JavaScript/JQuery/AJAX (REST API)
* Wordpress (CMS)
* CSS / SASS
* HTML 
* GULP-GIT

# Basic IDEA

Create a Database with different Quotes, on the main screen every time that the user loads the page, a different quote will appear. Thiss project was created using the 
Wordpress loop and PHP language. Additional, every time a user pushes the button on the main Screen, it will generate a get process using the AJAX
technology which means that the page is not going to refresh it will bring the quote immediately, Asynchronous. 

# M queries  

This project was specially created for 3 differents screens mobil (under 620px), tablet (under 1080px) and screens (over 1080px), I used the 
mquerie for this, combining the SASS (mixin). 

# AJAX

Ajax was used for getting and posting information directly to the database. Any user (with proper permission) could post any new quote,
which will be posted on hold until one of the administer will post it on our webpage. 

# Javascript / JQuery

I used the jquery wrapper if you notice in my code I use the Tag Jquery every time i need to call it, and I didn't use the shortcode $. This had to be because WordPress has preinstalled jquery, and I didn't want to uninstall it to install it again. 

# metaData 

In this project also we learnt how to call data from the metadata, it was used in the wordpress home area.
